        <h2>About This Website</h2>
        <p>This personal website has been created to showcase my journey, skills, and background 
            in a clean and organized manner. It includes a detailed Resume, an editable Bio-data page, 
            and a user-friendly Home page for easy navigation.
        </p>

        <p>
            The website is built using modern web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, 
            with a focus on responsiveness and simplicity. It is designed to give visitors 
            a quick overview of who I am, what I have learned, and the projects I am working on.
        </p>

        <p>
            The site is hosted on GitHub Pages for fast, free, and reliable online access. 
            More features will be added as I continue improving my web development skills.
